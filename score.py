        Returns: data, a string read from the file 
                 (returns nothing but exit gracefully if error occurs)
        
        Does: Reads all scores from the score file (​one score per line with 
              a space between the user’s name and their score) to a single 
              string, and returns the string. Linebreaks are reserved. 
              However, if the file does not exist, returns empty string; 
              if the file cannot be read, returns nothing.

              exists, writes at the end of the file for mode='a', or 
              rewrites the file for mode='w'; creates and writes the file

        Does: Updates the score file. The format is one score per line with 
              a space between the user’s name and their score. Appends a 
              linebreak if the last line ends with no linebreak. The highest 
              score is ​always t​he first entry in the file. If the user is

              first line of the file; otherwise, they go at the end. 
              Returns user's record in string if updating successfully;
